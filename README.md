# Final Project - Weather App using OpenWeatherMap api
Run this locally because it doesn't work the same way
* Get a free api key from http://openweathermap.org/price 
* Find  `var params` object in app.js and set api_key to yours
* Run locally
     * Type in zip or city and click submit and you'll save your location to a list on the right (Create)
     * Click on each link to ping opwm api and retrieve some weather stats and display them on the page
     * Click on the trash icon next to any location link to delete that location
 TODO: figure out what the deal is with ParseObjectType and heroku and how to deploy. Then do it

everything’s pinned to the #general channel)

While you’re testing locally, don’t forget to run `http-server` in the project folder to serve up these files. Here’s a link to our deployment tutorial
